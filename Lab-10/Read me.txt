In this lab I have implemented the "First Come First Serve Disk Scheduling Algorithm"

Here is how to use the executabe file of this algorithm:

1. Enter the maximum range of the disk
2. Enter the size of queue request
3. Enter the queues gradually
4. Enter the initial head position

Then we will get our expected result.

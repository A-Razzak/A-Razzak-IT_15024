In this lab report I tried to implement the "Round Robin Algorithm"
Here is how to work with the executable file given in this file

1.Enter the number of processes
2.Input the arrival and burst time for the processes gradually
3.Enter the time quantum

Then we will get our expected process,Turnaround Time, Waiting Time,Average
Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time.
